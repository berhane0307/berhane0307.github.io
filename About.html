      <p>
        My Name is Berhane Fesehaye, originally from Eritrea. Having spent four
        years in neighboring Ethiopia and another four in New Zealand. My
        academic background lies in accounting, and I served as an accountant in
        Eritrea for three years. Beyond my professional life, I find joy in
        singing and playing traditional instruments like the kirar and harp. In
        Ethiopia, my focus shifted to digital marketing where I also embraced
        the role of a YouTuber with my own channel. Looking ahead, my
        aspirations revolve around becoming an educated individual, taking on
        responsibilities for my family and community, with the ultimate goal of
        returning to my sacred homeland Eritrea to spend the rest of my life
        there.
