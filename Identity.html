    <h1>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h1>
    <p>
      when i was working in broadcasting service in Eritrea , someone tried to
      take credit for my work. I had to make a decision. I focused on being
      honest and fair. I discussed the situation with my colleague and
      supervisor. Looking back, it was hard, but it strengthened my commitment
      to doing the right thing and handling work problems in a professional
      manner."

    <h1>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h1>
    <p>
      My culture and the people I'm around taught me to respect elders and get
      along with everyone. This makes me value kindness and cooperation. It
      shapes who I am, and I try to be understanding and helpful in how I treat
      others.

    <h1>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h1>
    <p>
      I'm good at staying organized, being persistent, and keeping an open mind.
      These strengths will help me learn better. I can plan well, stick to my
      goals, and approach new things with a positive and flexible attitude. I
      think these strengths will make my learning journey successful and
      interesting.

    <h1>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h1>
    <p>
      I struggle with time management, which could impact my learning. Limited
      experience in some areas might require extra effort for my career.
      However, I view these challenges as opportunities for improvement and
      growth.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Once, when helping with a community event, some people didn't like some
      ideas. I tried talking and finding middle ground, but it didn't work well.
      Now, I'd try to include everyone in planning to avoid problems.After the
      community event, I looked back and thought about it. Even though I talked
      and tried to fix things, it didn't go perfectly. I learned that if I
      include everyone in planning from the beginning, things might go better
      next time.
