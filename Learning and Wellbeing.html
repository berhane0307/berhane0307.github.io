<h1>Accuracy of Expectations:
</h1>
<p>My initial expectations aligned well with my learning needs and growth areas. I anticipated the need to strengthen my coding skills and improve collaboration within a team setting, which proved to be accurate throughout bootcamp.</p>

<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Surprises and Discoveries:
    </h1>
    <p>One surprise was realizing how much I enjoyed working on front-end development tasks, despite initially focusing more on backend technologies. This discovery allowed me to pivot my learning plan slightly to explore frontend frameworks further.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Challenges Encountered:
    </h1>
    <p>One challenge I faced was maintaining a balance between coding tasks and personal wellbeing activities outlined in my plan. At times, I found it challenging to allocate sufficient time for both without feeling overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Benefits of Plan Adherence:
    </h1>
    <p>Following my learning and wellbeing plans closely provided a sense of structure and accountability throughout bootcamp. It helped me stay organized, focused, and motivated to achieve my goals. Additionally, incorporating regular wellbeing practices into my routine contributed to overall resilience and stress management.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Application of Wellbeing Goals:
    </h1>
    
    <p>In adhering to my wellbeing plan, I allocated specific time slots for activities aligned with each aspect of wellbeing. <br>
       <strong>Taha Wairua (Spiritual wellbeing),</strong> I set aside time each day for meditation or reflection, nurturing my spiritual well-being. <br><strong> Tinana (Physical wellbeing)</strong>was addressed by committing to engaging in physical activity for at least 30 minutes daily, whether through walks or gym sessions. <br>Additionally, I scheduled regular phone calls with family members to enhance <strong> WhƒÅnau (Family wellbeing).</strong> <br>To promote <strong>Taha Hinengaro (Mental wellbeing),</strong> I practiced mindfulness techniques daily to manage stress effectively. <br>Lastly, for <strong> Whenua (Connection to nature),</strong> I ensured to spend time outdoors each week, indulging in activities like gardening, hiking, or simply enjoying nature.</p>
