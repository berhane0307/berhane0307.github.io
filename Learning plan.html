    <h2>My Bootcamp learning plan</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I'm laying out my plan for the upcoming Bootcamp at Dev Academy. This plan helps me set goals, understand my strengths and weaknesses, and know what to expect.
</p>
<br>
    <br>
    <br>
  
    <h1>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
    <p>I want to become really good at making websites and software. Eventually, I hope to find a job where I can keep learning and growing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>
    <p>Not giving up: Even when things get tough, I keep trying hard to do well in the bootcamp.
      <br>
      Talking with others: While I'm okay working alone, I know it's important to talk well with my team. I might need to get better at this.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
    
    <p>My primary non-technical challenge during the bootcamp will likely involve presenting in front of the group.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
    <p>Staying focused and motivated for nine weeks will be tough. I'll need to find ways to keep myself going strong.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>
    <p>I expect the Bootcamp team to support me, give clear instructions, and help me when I need it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h1>
    <p>I'll work hard, ask for help when I need it, and stay focused on my goals.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Commitment to managing workload</h1>
    <p>I promise to manage my time well and work safely with others. I'll communicate openly and respectfully, and I'll make sure to take care of myself so I can stay productive and focused.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
<h2>Foundations learning plan</h2>
<br>
    <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to become a versatile programmer, seamlessly blending
      technical expertise with creativity.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h1>
    <p>
      I'm good at learning when I'm interested and excited about something. But,
      if I don't find it interesting, I might put it off and get distracted. I'm
      working on staying focused and motivated, even when the topic isn't as
      exciting for me.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h1>
    <p>
      I want to get better at talking with others and working in a team at Dev
      Academy. These skills are important for any job, and I think they'll make
      me a stronger overall professional.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
      productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
      industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
      building up and starting to get to you
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am committed to handle my work responsibly, communicating well with
      others. If things get too much, I'll take short breaks, talk to
      classmates, and, if necessary, ask facilitators for help.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
    <p>
      I am committed to ask for help quickly when I need it. I'll use Discord or
      other suitable channels to talk to facilitators and classmates for timely
      assistance.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
    <p>
      I hope the Facilitation team guides me well, supports my learning, and
      gives helpful feedback like they are doing. Having their assistance when I
      need it will be important for my development.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Right now, I don't have specific commitments. I've told my family and
      friends that Dev Academy is my main focus during the course, so I can be
      fully available for it.
