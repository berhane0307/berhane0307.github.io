    <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to become a versatile programmer, seamlessly blending
      technical expertise with creativity.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h1>
    <p>
      I'm good at learning when I'm interested and excited about something. But,
      if I don't find it interesting, I might put it off and get distracted. I'm
      working on staying focused and motivated, even when the topic isn't as
      exciting for me.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h1>
    <p>
      I want to get better at talking with others and working in a team at Dev
      Academy. These skills are important for any job, and I think they'll make
      me a stronger overall professional.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
      productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
      industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
      building up and starting to get to you
    </h1>
    <p>
      I am committed to handle my work responsibly, communicating well with
      others. If things get too much, I'll take short breaks, talk to
      classmates, and, if necessary, ask facilitators for help.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
    <p>
      I am committed to ask for help quickly when I need it. I'll use Discord or
      other suitable channels to talk to facilitators and classmates for timely
      assistance.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h1>
    <p>
      I hope the Facilitation team guides me well, supports my learning, and
      gives helpful feedback like they are doing. Having their assistance when I
      need it will be important for my development.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Right now, I don't have specific commitments. I've told my family and
      friends that Dev Academy is my main focus during the course, so I can be
      fully available for it.
