<h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence  means understanding and handling feelings in yourself and others. It's about knowing what you feel, controlling your emotions, and understanding how others feel. Having high EI helps you communicate better, work well with others, and make good choices. It's like a social skill that makes relationships smoother, reduces stress, and helps in making smart decisions. EQ is crucial in jobs and everyday life because it makes you more aware of emotions, whether they're yours or someone else's, leading to better connections and overall happiness. Developing EI involves learning to listen well and manage emotions wisely.

    <h1>How is EQ different to IQ?</h1>
    <p>
      EQ and IQ are like different kinds of smarts. IQ is about book smarts—how well you can solve problems and think logically. It's like school smartness. EQ is about people smarts—understanding feelings, being good with others, and handling emotions. While IQ helps with learning facts, EQ helps in friendships, teamwork, and managing stress. You can be super smart in school (high IQ) but might find it hard to get along with people if your EQ is low. Both are important for doing well in life, just in different ways. It's like having both brain and heart smarts.

    <h1>Why is EQ important?</h1>
    <p>
      EQ is important because it helps with feelings and relationships. It's like having a good understanding of how you and others feel. When you're good at EQ, you communicate better, work well in teams, and make better choices. It's important at work and in everyday life because it reduces stress, improves friendships, and makes you good at handling emotions. If you're aware of how people feel, you can connect better with them. EQ is like a social skill that makes life smoother, less stressful, and more enjoyable. It's about being smart with emotions, which is just as important as being smart in other ways.
