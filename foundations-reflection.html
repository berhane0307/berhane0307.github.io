        <h1>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>
        <p> - I learned I can push through tough coding challenges.
          <br>
          - I discovered asking for help is okay and makes me better.
          <br>
          - I found out I don't have to be perfect right away, taking small steps is good too.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
        <h1>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
        <p>Values are important because they help programmers make good decisions based on what they believe is right.
          <br> Empathy means understanding and caring about other people's feelings, which helps programmers create software that meets users' needs. 
          <br>Self-awareness means knowing your own strengths and weaknesses, which helps programmers improve and learn more effectively. These things are all important for learning and doing programming well.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
          <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
        <p>The most surprising thing was how interconnected all the concepts are, seeing how they all fit together in programming.</p>
        <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
        <p>I liked learning the basics, even though it was tough sometimes. But figuring out how to solve problems was exciting, so I don't really remember which part was the hardest.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>
        <p>  - The school wants us to be good at more than just coding, like teamwork and making good choices.
          <br>
          - Learning core ideas helps us see why coding matters and how it fits into the real world.
       
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
        <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h1>
        <p>No, I don't think studying core learning here was a waste of time. It's important to understand the basics because they help you become better at programming later on. While practicing programming is also important, knowing the fundamentals sets a strong foundation for future learning and problem-solving.</p>
