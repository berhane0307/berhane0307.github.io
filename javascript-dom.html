      <h1>JavaScript,HTML and CSS</h1>
      <p>
        Hey there! Imagine you're a web developer and your code is like building
        a digital playground. Now, let's talk about three essential buddies in
        this playground: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>JavaScript, the Puppet Master</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          Think of JavaScript like the puppet master behind the scenes pulling
          the strings. HTML provides the structure (like the slides and swings),
          CSS styles things up (adding colours and designs) and then JavaScript
          brings it all to life. It's the one making things move, responding to
          your clicks, and adding a touch of magic to your digital playground
        </p>
        <br />

      </section>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Control Flow and Loops, AKA Choreography</h1>
      <p>
        Control flow is like choreographing a dance routine. Loops are your
        dance steps repeating until a certain condition is met. Let us say
        you're baking cookies: you mix ingredients, put dough in the oven and
        repeat until you have a tray full of deliciousness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img id="example" src="./ex.png" alt="ex.js" />
      <br />
      <p>
        In this code, the loop repeats the process of baking a cookie 12 times,
        filling your tray with freshly baked goodness.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>DOM, Your Playground Blueprint</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is like the blueprint of your
        playground. It's a structured representation of your HTML, and
        JavaScript uses it to interact with your webpage. Imagine you have a
        checklist for your playground equipment – that's the DOM.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img id="example" src="./dom.png" alt="dom.js" />
      <p>
        Here, JavaScript finds the button in the DOM by its ID and changes its
        background color to green.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Arrays vs. Objects: Data's Wardrobe</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Arrays and objects work as the having to walk into your wardrobe coding
        store. Arrays are ordered lists, much like having an ordered sock
        collection that has a certain place for each pair of socks. Objects,
        much like accessories, bring flair - each property containing its own
        name. Such coding elements as a proper wardrobe does add to the
        efficiency and orderliness of your code, providing for orderly storage
        and retrieval of information.
      </p>
      <img id="example" src="./A and O.png" alt="Arrays" />
      <h1>Functions: Your Code's Helpers</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Functions are the superheroes of your code. Imagine them as mini-scripts
        that can be called to perform specific tasks. They save you from
        repeating the same code over and over. For example, if you have a recipe
        for making pancakes, you could encapsulate it in a function called
        ⁠ makePancakes() ⁠.
      </p>
      <img id="example" src="./function.png" alt="Functions" />
      <br />
      <p>
        So, in simple terms, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create
        cool digital experiences, and now you know a bit more about the friends
        behind the scenes.
