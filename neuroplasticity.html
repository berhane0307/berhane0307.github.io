        brains are flexible and can keep growing, which encourages a positive
        attitude towards learning and personal growth.

      <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h1>
      <p>A growth mindset means thinking that you can get smarter and better at things by working hard and learning. It's different from a fixed mindset, which believes that abilities are fixed and can't change much. Having a growth mindset is good because it helps you face challenges, learn from mistakes, and keep trying even when things are tough. It's like believing that with effort and learning, you can improve and achieve more in what you do, making life more positive and exciting.</p>

      <h1>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>
      <p>I was surprised because I learned that exercising regularly can make my mood and thinking better. Now, I want to do more physical activities.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h1>
      <p>I'll keep trying new things, even if they're hard. If I make mistakes, I'll see them as chances to learn. I want to set goals, stay positive, and listen to feedback. That way, I can get better at what I'm learning and not give up when things get tough.</p>

      <h1>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h1>
      <p>When you're learning or thinking about something, it's always worthwhile. In coding, when you struggle with a big problem, you're not only fixing that one issue. You're getting better at solving problems in general. So, the skills you pick up from one problem help you tackle new and different problems later on.</p>
