    <h1>How I overcame a challenge with a straightforward issue.</h1>
    <p>Once, I was trying to do something on the computer, and I got stuck on a basic problem. I needed to flip a word backward in JavaScript, which is a common coding challenge. But my usual way of solving it didn't work, and I felt confused.

      The problem was that I made it harder than it needed to be. Instead of using simple methods, I was trying to be too clever. After a while, I took a break and looked at the problem again with fresh eyes. I decided to use an easier solution with basic tools available in JavaScript.
      
      During this time, I felt a mix of frustration and self-doubt. But when I finally solved the problem with a simpler approach, I felt relieved and proud. This experience taught me that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones. It's okay to step back and rethink things when you're stuck. It's not about making things complicated but finding a solution that works well.</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h1>How I Elegantly solved a problem.</h1>
      <p>This issue involved finding an object with a specific property key-value pair, but there were problems in the code, like checking the wrong property key and using an incorrect backup plan.

        To resolve this, I carefully read the problem and adjusted the code to exactly match the provided key and value. I ensured the function followed the rule of returning null when the object wasn't found.
        
        Throughout this process, I remained focused, aiming for clear and correct code that fulfilled the outlined requirements.
        
        This experience taught me the importance of paying close attention to details in coding challenges, ensuring every part of the problem is accurately reflected in the code. I also realized how small mistakes, like checking the wrong key, can significantly impact a program's functionality.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I'm kind of sure. Breaking problems into steps is okay, but it's a bit tricky with given pointers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Trying something: </strong>I'm okay. Trying new things is good, but I can go the wrong way sometimes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I'm good. Reading things out loud helps me.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Reading error messages</strong>I'm fine. Even if it takes me a while, I'm content with the process.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Console.logging:</strong>I'm learning. Used it a bit, still getting used to it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Googling:</strong>I'm well. I rely on Google to help me solve problems.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Asking peers for help: </strong>I'm getting better. It's challenging initially, but I recognize its worth.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong>I'm confident. Usually the last choice, but they can solve the problem.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Improving with reflection:</strong>I understand. It can be challenging to make changes, but recognizing and reflecting on things is a good start.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>The time I didn't want to ask for help.</h1>
        <p>I remember a time I didn't want to ask for help. I was worried about seeming weak or bothering others. Next time, I'll try to remember it's okay to ask for help when I need it.</p>
